# ChainScrape

ChainScrape is a Python-based project that combines web scraping, automation, robotic process automation (RPA), and blockchain technology. It provides a set of tools and utilities to scrape data from websites, automate repetitive tasks, interact with blockchain networks, and process the scraped data using smart contracts. The project aims to simplify the process of extracting data, automating workflows, and leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## Features

- Web scraping: Extract data from websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks and workflows using the Selenium library.
- RPA capabilities: Perform robotic process automation on web applications to streamline business processes.
- Blockchain interaction: Interact with blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) using the web3.py library.
- Smart contract integration: Process the scraped data using smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zhoumengru2008/ChainScrape.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
- Set up your API keys for the websites you want to scrape (if required).
- Configure your blockchain connection settings in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

1. Run the `web_scraper.py` script to scrape data from websites:

python web_scraper.py


The script will extract the specified data from the configured websites and store it in a local file.

2. Customize the `automation.py` script to define your automation workflows. Use the provided functions and methods to interact with web elements, automate tasks, and process the scraped data.

```python
from automation import Automation

automation = Automation()

# Example: Automate a web workflow
def automate_workflow():
    automation.open_website('https://www.example.com')
    automation.login('username', 'password')
    automation.scrape_data()
    automation.process_data()

# Run the automation workflow
automate_workflow()
Customize the automation workflow based on your specific requirements and the data you want to process.

Use the blockchain_interaction.py script to interact with the blockchain:

from blockchain_interaction import BlockchainInteraction

blockchain = BlockchainInteraction()

# Example: Get account balance
balance = blockchain.get_account_balance('0x1234567890abcdef...')

# Example: Send a transaction
transaction_hash = blockchain.send_transaction('0x1234567890abcdef...', '0x9876543210fedcba...', 1.0)

# Example: Interact with a smart contract
contract = blockchain.load_contract('0x1234567890abcdef...')
result = contract.functions.my_function().call()

# Customize the blockchain interactions based on your requirements.
Update the script with your blockchain connection settings, account addresses, and smart contract details.
